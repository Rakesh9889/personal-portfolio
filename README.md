1. What was the most challenging part for you?

The most challenging part was building a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS for the first time. Understanding how utility-first CSS works and organizing sections like the hero and about section in a visually appealing way was tricky initially.

2. How did you solve it? (Mention if you used Chat GPT, YouTube, Docs, etc.

I solved most of the challenges using a combination of Tailwind CSS official documentation, YouTube tutorials, and Chat GPT for quick help and component structure suggestions. I also referred to sample portfolio layouts for design inspiration.


3. What did you learn during this task?

I learned how to:
Structure a responsive single-page website using Tailwind CSS
Implement sections like hero, services, about, and contact form
Deploy a live project using GitHub and GitHub Pages
Maintain proper folder structure and write meaningful README.md files

4. If we ask you to improve it tomorrow, what would you add?

If given a chance, I would add:
A downloadable PDF resume section
A testimonials or project portfolio carousel
Animations on scroll using libraries like AOS.js
Better SEO tags and Open Graph preview tags

5. What is your goal for the next 3 months if selected?

If selected, my goal for the next 3 months is to:
Deepen my knowledge of JavaScript and React.js.
Build 3–4 more real-world projects to showcase
Learn Git workflows, team collaboration using GitHub, and deployment with CI/CD tools
Prepare for full-time frontend developer roles with confidence
